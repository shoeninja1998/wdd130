    <h2>Brad Rennick</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! As you already know, my name is Brad. I'm from Kansas City, and I'm a design major here.</p>
    <p>I love music, playing and composing. Back in high school, I played the saxaphone and bassoon.
        Right now, I've got my eyes set on learning the piano, but that's proving to be really tough.
        I like to draw too, though I'm still working on that skill. I like playing sports (although not competitively), and doing things outside.
       KC doesn't have many scenic places, but I've heard Idaho has some really beautiful spots. I'm really excited to see some!</p>
